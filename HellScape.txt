Ok, here is my wishlist.

Dear Santa, I want...

* A science fiction story
* I'm fond of the Zelda series, so a game that is inspired by Zelda, or has some references or cameo's related to Zelda (I'm especially fond of Zelda II - the adventure of link, because that's the first one I played. At the moment, I'm playing skyward sword HD)
* Warm socks

=============================================

How I achieved the rules:

* I made a Zelda II alike world with a big map on top view and some dungeons in side view. Permanent world, only the monsters are reset betweens dungeons / starts.

=============================================

How to play:

* You are Kwink. You have to save princess HellScape which is kept prisonner by an Ogre
* You directly start on the main map. Move around and kill some simple monsters to gain a bit of XP/Life before trying yourself at the dungeons. 
* Each dungeons is guarded by a lot of mobs. Killing them is up to you. Leveling up before being traped in a dungeon is recommended
* Find all the 3 key fragments before going onto the last dungeon. Deliver princess HellScape by defeating the last mob

Keys:

* Esc: quit
* Arrow keys: move, go up/down or jump/crouch
* CTRL/LeftMouseButton: attack
* F1 -> F4t: change weapon (Wood stick, sword, magic bow, magic wand)
* Key PAD PLUS: shield potion
* Key PAD ENTER: health potion

Items to be collected:

* shield (passive, always equiped once found)
* sword of HellScape
* magic ice wand
* infinite arrow bow
* health potion
* shield potion

Obtain: the kiss of the princess one the Ogre is dead !

Tips:

* Leveling up a bit on easy monsters before trying yourself to a dungeon
* Wandering around and use the map find the sword, the magic wand, the arrow, the shield
* Loot a bit of potions before entering the last dungeon

==============================================

Options: 

* configurable log level, example: ./HellScape.exe -V DEBUG 
* cheat: editable player_state.json after first execution

==============================================
