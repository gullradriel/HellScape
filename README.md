My wishlist:

1. I like building, management, and systems that interact with each other.
2. Space, robots, aliens!
3. A game where violence isn't front-and-center.
4. Red is my favorite color.
5. Music!

You don't have to use all of these ideas :)

=============================================

How I achieved the rules:

1. You're a robot that is interacting with it's environment to save his life
2. After being attacked by an Aliens, a spaceship containing robots have crashed into a hellish kind of planet. You're
   the only surviving one 
3. You have to help your robot escape from the planet, avoiding various corrosives and hot eruptions, and reach the
   safety module that have correctly landed somewhere. You have to search for it, explore the map
3. Red
4. Music :-)

=============================================

How to play:

* Explore the area with your robot using direction keys, try to find helpfull items to collect and to help you in your
  search
* Magic blocks are a must as they can bend the path of corrosive fluids

=============================================

Keys:

* Direction keys
* Mouse to interact with special blocks / aim
* Mouse left button or space to attack
* Key F1 to F... select item assigned to key. When you collect an item it is autoassigned to one.

=============================================

Items to be collected:

* Armour
* Magic blocks that you can add and remove on the map to help you access some parts of the map, or block something with
it. Don't forget to collect it back if you do not need it anymore. Magic blocks are put and removed remotely, using the
mouse pointer.
* Radar with map and pointers to safety spaceship location
* Old tape radio with a few more songs to listen while playing

==============================================

Options: 

* Configurable log level, example: ./HellscapeSpaceShuttle.exe -V DEBUG 
* Cheat: editable player_state.json after first execution

==============================================

Build: 

* Need gcc and allegro5 installed 
* Makefile works on Linux, Windows

==============================================
